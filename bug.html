This error occurs when using Tailwind CSS's `@apply` directive with a utility class that doesn't exist or is misspelled.  For example:

```html
<div class="bg-blue-500 @apply text-red-700 text-wrong-color">
  Some text
</div>
```

If `text-wrong-color` is not defined in your Tailwind configuration, you'll likely see no visual error, but your CSS might be invalid or unexpected.  The `@apply` directive silently ignores unknown classes.
